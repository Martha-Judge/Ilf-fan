    <h1>Research has shown donkeys are the <strong>best</strong> animals in the
       world</h1>
    <h2>But <em>why</em> are they so great?</h2>
   <p>Donkeys would make the best pet. In colder weather you can dress them in
      winter coats and perhaps even booties, but in the summer they can be chic
      little creatures with hats and daisy chains. You would be the coolest kid
      on the block owning one of these bad bois, not saying donkeys are objects.
      They are magnificent. I mean look...</p>
      <p>Here's a winter donkey and what I can only imagine a summer donkey
        would look like...</p>
