    <h1>Research has shown donkeys are the best animal in the world</h1>
    <h2>But <em>why</em> are they so great?</h2>
   <p>Donkeys would make the best pet. In colder weather you can dress them in
      winter coats and perhaps even booties, but in the summer they can be chic
      little creatures with hats and daisy chains. You would be the coolest kid
      on the block owning one of these bad bois, not saying donkeys are objects.
      They are magnificent. I mean look...</p>
      <p>Here's a winter donkey and what I can only imagine a summer donkey
        would look like...</p>

      <p>There is more to a donkey than dressing them up and thinking they are
        cute, they are actually highly intelligent creatures with many
        interesting characteristics. Here are some juicy fun facts to get your
        eyes on...</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Their massive ears have different uses.</strong> Not only
            can they hear beautiful brays from 60 miles away, they control body
            temperature by releasing heat.</li>
          <li><strong>They can have up to 44 teeth.</strong> You wouldn't want
            to be gnash gnashed on by them.</li>
          <li><strong>The donkey has been used as a working animal for atleast
             5000 years :(</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Some donkeys are impressively hairy - take a look at this
             bad boy.</strong></li>
